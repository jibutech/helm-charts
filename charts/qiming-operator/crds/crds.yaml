                  are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when
                  embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which
                  are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath
                  are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It
                  is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most
                  embedded usages, there are particular restrictions like, "must refer
                  only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                  Those cannot be well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because
                  the usages are different, the validation rules are different by
                  usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                  4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not
                  a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                  and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on
                  the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct is
                  irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is
                  embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect numerous
                  schemas.  Don''t make new APIs embed an underspecified API type
                  they do not control. Instead of using this type, create a locally
                  provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference. For

                      type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage
                      when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many
                      fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion
                      and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2.
                      Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for
                      individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                      restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID
                      not honored" or "name must be restricted". Those cannot be well
                      described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because
                      the usages are different, the validation rules are different
                      by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will
                      happen. 4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind
                      is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                      during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases,
                      the dependency is on the group,resource tuple and the version
                      of the actual struct is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change
                      it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates
                      to this type will affect numerous schemas.  Don''t make new
                      APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control. Instead
                      of using this type, create a locally provided and used type
                      that is well-focused on your reference. For example, ServiceReferences
                      for admission registration: https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533

                          JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                          For example, if the object reference is to a container within
                          a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                          (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                          the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]"
                          (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen
                          only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part
                          of an object. TODO: this design is not final and this field

                                PVC will be deleted together with the pod.  The name
                                of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes`
                                array entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if
                                the concatenated name is not valid for a PVC (for
                                example, too long). \n An existing PVC with that name
                                that is not owned by the pod will *not* be used for
                                the pod to avoid using an unrelated volume by mistake.
                                Starting the pod is then blocked until the unrelated
                                PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is meant
                                to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with
                                an owner reference to the pod once the pod exists.
                                Normally this should not be necessary, but it may
                                be useful when manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                          uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty
                          describing its usage when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It
                          includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For
                          instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely
                          valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible
                          to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded
                          usages, there are particular restrictions like, "must refer
                          only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must
                          be restricted". Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                          3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different,
                          the validation rules are different by usage, which makes
                          it hard for users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields
                          are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                          mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                          and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency
                          is on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual
                          struct is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because
                          this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this
                          type will affect numerous schemas.  Don''t make new APIs
                          embed an underspecified API type they do not control. Instead
                          of using this type, create a locally provided and used type
                          that is well-focused on your reference. For example, ServiceReferences

                              For example, if the object reference is to a container
                              within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                              (where "name" refers to the name of the container that

                        of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing
                        its usage when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes
                        many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance,
                        ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in
                        actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to
                        add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded
                        usages, there are particular restrictions like, "must refer
                        only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must
                        be restricted". Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                        3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different,
                        the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it
                        hard for users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields
                        are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                        mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                        and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency
                        is on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual
                        struct is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because
                        this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                        will affect numerous schemas.  Don''t make new APIs embed
                        an underspecified API type they do not control. Instead of
                        using this type, create a locally provided and used type that
                        is well-focused on your reference. For example, ServiceReferences

                  are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when
                  embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which
                  are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath
                  are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It
                  is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most
                  embedded usages, there are particular restrictions like, "must refer
                  only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                  Those cannot be well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because
                  the usages are different, the validation rules are different by
                  usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                  4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not
                  a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                  and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on
                  the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct is
                  irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is
                  embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect numerous
                  schemas.  Don''t make new APIs embed an underspecified API type
                  they do not control. Instead of using this type, create a locally
                  provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference. For

                      For example, if the object reference is to a container within
                      a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                      (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered

                  are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when
                  embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which
                  are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath
                  are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It
                  is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most
                  embedded usages, there are particular restrictions like, "must refer
                  only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                  Those cannot be well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because
                  the usages are different, the validation rules are different by
                  usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                  4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not
                  a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                  and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on
                  the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct is
                  irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is
                  embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect numerous
                  schemas.  Don''t make new APIs embed an underspecified API type
                  they do not control. Instead of using this type, create a locally
                  provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference. For

                      For example, if the object reference is to a container within
                      a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"

                      when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many
                      fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion

                      Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for
                      individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                      restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID

                      described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because
                      the usages are different, the validation rules are different
                      by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will
                      happen. 4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind
                      is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                      during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases,
                      the dependency is on the group,resource tuple and the version

                  are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when
                  embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which
                  are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath
                  are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It
                  is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most
                  embedded usages, there are particular restrictions like, "must refer
                  only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                  Those cannot be well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because
                  the usages are different, the validation rules are different by
                  usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                  4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not
                  a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                  and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on
                  the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct is
                  irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is
                  embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect numerous
                  schemas.  Don''t make new APIs embed an underspecified API type
                  they do not control. Instead of using this type, create a locally
                  provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference. For
                  example, ServiceReferences for admission registration: https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533

                  are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when
                  embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which
                  are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath
                  are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It
                  is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most
                  embedded usages, there are particular restrictions like, "must refer
                  only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                  Those cannot be well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because
                  the usages are different, the validation rules are different by
                  usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                  4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not
                  a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                  and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on
                  the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct is
                  irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is
                  embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect numerous
                  schemas.  Don''t make new APIs embed an underspecified API type

                        of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing
                        its usage when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes
                        many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance,
                        ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in
                        actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to
                        add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded
                        usages, there are particular restrictions like, "must refer
                        only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must
                        be restricted". Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                        3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different,
                        the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it
                        hard for users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields
                        are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                        mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                        and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency
                        is on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual

                  schemas.  Don''t make new APIs embed an underspecified API type
                  they do not control. Instead of using this type, create a locally
                  provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference. For

                      For example, if the object reference is to a container within
                      a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"

                  are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when
                  embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which
                  are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath
                  are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It
                  is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most
                  embedded usages, there are particular restrictions like, "must refer
                  only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                  Those cannot be well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because
                  the usages are different, the validation rules are different by
                  usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                  4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not
                  a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                  and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on
                  the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct is
                  irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is
                  embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect numerous
                  schemas.  Don''t make new APIs embed an underspecified API type
                  they do not control. Instead of using this type, create a locally
                  provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference. For

                      For example, if the object reference is to a container within
                      a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                      (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered

                  are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when
                  embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which
                  are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath
                  are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It
                  is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most
                  embedded usages, there are particular restrictions like, "must refer
                  only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                  Those cannot be well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because
                  the usages are different, the validation rules are different by
                  usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                  4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not
                  a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                  and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on
                  the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct is
                  irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is
                  embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect numerous
                  schemas.  Don''t make new APIs embed an underspecified API type
                  they do not control. Instead of using this type, create a locally
                  provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference. For

                      For example, if the object reference is to a container within
                      a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                      (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                      the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]"

                  are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when
                  embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which
                  are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath
                  are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It
                  is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most
                  embedded usages, there are particular restrictions like, "must refer
                  only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                  Those cannot be well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because
                  the usages are different, the validation rules are different by
                  usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                  4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not
                  a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                  and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on
                  the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct is
                  irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is
                  embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect numerous
                  schemas.  Don''t make new APIs embed an underspecified API type
                  they do not control. Instead of using this type, create a locally
                  provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference. For

                      For example, if the object reference is to a container within
                      a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                      (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered

                  are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when
                  embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which
                  are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath
                  are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It
                  is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most
                  embedded usages, there are particular restrictions like, "must refer
                  only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                  Those cannot be well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because
                  the usages are different, the validation rules are different by
                  usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                  4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not
                  a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                  and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on
                  the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct is
                  irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is
                  embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect numerous
                  schemas.  Don''t make new APIs embed an underspecified API type

                  are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when
                  embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which
                  are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath
                  are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It
                  is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most
                  embedded usages, there are particular restrictions like, "must refer
                  only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                  Those cannot be well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because
                  the usages are different, the validation rules are different by
                  usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                  4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not
                  a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                  and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on
                  the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct is
                  irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is
                  embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect numerous
                  schemas.  Don''t make new APIs embed an underspecified API type

                      type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage
                      when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many
                      fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion
                      and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2.
                      Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for
                      individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                      restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID
                      not honored" or "name must be restricted". Those cannot be well
                      described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because
                      the usages are different, the validation rules are different
                      by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will
                      happen. 4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind
                      is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                      during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases,
                      the dependency is on the group,resource tuple and the version
                      of the actual struct is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change
                      it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates
                      to this type will affect numerous schemas.  Don''t make new
                      APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control. Instead
                      of using this type, create a locally provided and used type
                      that is well-focused on your reference. For example, ServiceReferences

                  are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when
                  embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which
                  are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath
                  are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It
                  is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most
                  embedded usages, there are particular restrictions like, "must refer
                  only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                  Those cannot be well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because
                  the usages are different, the validation rules are different by
                  usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                  4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not
                  a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                  and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on
                  the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct is
                  irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is
                  embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect numerous
                  schemas.  Don''t make new APIs embed an underspecified API type
                  they do not control. Instead of using this type, create a locally
                  provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference. For

                  are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when
                  embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which
                  are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath
                  are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It
                  is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most
                  embedded usages, there are particular restrictions like, "must refer
                  only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                  Those cannot be well described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because
                  the usages are different, the validation rules are different by
                  usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                  4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not
                  a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                  and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on
                  the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct is
                  irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is
                  embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect numerous
                  schemas.  Don''t make new APIs embed an underspecified API type
                  they do not control. Instead of using this type, create a locally
                  provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference. For
                  example, ServiceReferences for admission registration: https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533

                      type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage
                      when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many
                      fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion
                      and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2.
                      Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for
                      individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                      restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID
                      not honored" or "name must be restricted". Those cannot be well
                      described when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because
                      the usages are different, the validation rules are different
                      by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will
                      happen. 4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind
                      is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                      during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases,
                      the dependency is on the group,resource tuple and the version
                      of the actual struct is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change
                      it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates
                      to this type will affect numerous schemas.  Don''t make new
                      APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control. Instead
                      of using this type, create a locally provided and used type
                      that is well-focused on your reference. For example, ServiceReferences

                        of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing
                        its usage when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes
                        many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance,
                        ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in
                        actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to
                        add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded
                        usages, there are particular restrictions like, "must refer
                        only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must
                        be restricted". Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                        3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different,
                        the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it
                        hard for users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields
                        are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                        mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                        and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency
                        is on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual
                        struct is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because
                        this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                        will affect numerous schemas.  Don''t make new APIs embed
                        an underspecified API type they do not control. Instead of
                        using this type, create a locally provided and used type that
                        is well-focused on your reference. For example, ServiceReferences

                    type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage
                    when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields
                    which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion
                    and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid
                    usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual
                    usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular restrictions
                    like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored"
                    or "name must be restricted". Those cannot be well described when
                    embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are
                    different, the validation rules are different by usage, which
                    makes it hard for users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields
                    are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                    mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                    and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is
                    on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct
                    is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type
                    is embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect
                    numerous schemas.  Don''t make new APIs embed an underspecified
                    API type they do not control. Instead of using this type, create
                    a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your
                    reference. For example, ServiceReferences for admission registration:
                    https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533

                    type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage
                    when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields
                    which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion
                    and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid
                    usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual
                    usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular restrictions
                    like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored"
                    or "name must be restricted". Those cannot be well described when
                    embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are
                    different, the validation rules are different by usage, which
                    makes it hard for users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields
                    are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                    mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                    and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is
                    on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct
                    is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type
                    is embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect
                    numerous schemas.  Don''t make new APIs embed an underspecified
                    API type they do not control. Instead of using this type, create
                    a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your
                    reference. For example, ServiceReferences for admission registration:
                    https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533
                    .'

                        field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within
                        a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                        (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                        the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]"

                        an object. TODO: this design is not final and this field is
                        subject to change in the future.'
